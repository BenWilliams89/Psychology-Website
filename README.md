Capstone Project - Psychology Website:

![Website Preview](/assets/emily.png)

Introduction:

- I built a website for a doctor of psychology who is looking for her own website.

Website Goals:

- The website main goal is to get visitors to book an appointment with the doctor
- Other goals are to ensure all information on the site is easily accessible
- The website is desktop, tablet & mobile responsive

Key Features:

- Website owner Emily is able to add, edit & delete blogs from the website.
- This is easier then going to the admin panel each time, this was added to increase her efficency.
- Website visitors are not able to edit, or delete blogs due to user autherisation
- User autherisation is added to allow users to comment on blogs to make the website more engaging.
- A booking form linked to Emilys email allows users to book a meeting directly into her calander.
- Navbar & footer links have been added for easy accessability to different site sections.


Built With:

- HTML, CSS, & Bootstrap = Frontend
- Python & Django = Backend
- Django = Database

Deployment:

- Website is live on Heroku and github pages


UX - User Experience:

- The website should have a trusted feel as the client is a doctor
- The website should have a neutral colour scheme that favours trust while remaining clear for users to digest the content

Agile Methodologies:

-

The use of AI:

- Chat GPT helped me create blog posts that were inline with the services that the website offer
- AI was used to create the ERD from my inital outlines
