Rundown of what I want to achieve:

- Functioning website where a user can book a meeting for a free assesment

- The website has a responsive navbar, a hero section, a about section & a booking section - all on one page

- The website will also contain a Blog as a seperate page showcasing three blog posts

- Each blog post will have the ability to create, read, update and delete comments

- The user will have to log in to interactive with the blog

- The user will need to be authenicated via a username/email and password.
